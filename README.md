# Ticket Booking Demo (Inspired by Alibaba) 🎫✨

Welcome to my **Ticket Booking Demo** project! This is a front-end web application inspired by Alibaba's ticket booking platform, designed to showcase the **add-to-cart** functionality using **LocalStorage**. 🚀

## About the Project
This project demonstrates my skills in **front-end development** and **client-side storage**. The site mimics a ticket booking interface where users can add tickets to a cart, with the cart data persisted using **LocalStorage**. It’s a clean and functional example of my ability to create interactive web experiences. 🎨

## Features
- 🎟️ Ticket selection and add-to-cart functionality
- 🛒 Cart data stored locally using LocalStorage
- 🛠️ Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
